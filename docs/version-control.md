## Version Control 
- While working on your project, it will be much easier to have a location you can host files on for a variety of reasons
    - Working with multiple people
    - TODO More things on this list
    - Hosting an issue tracker and being able to easily reference while making commits. Helps keep track of everything


## How to setup a repo (will add a cursory list of how to get started)
- Readme file
- .gitignore
    - this will be helpful so you do not commit files like options.txt (TODO - expand more on this)
    - Public or Private? What works best?
    - This is your preference. I personally prefer to start projects privately and mark them as public once the pack goes live
    - Mod files (or .jar files) cannot be redistributed in most cases outside of their original post location (Curseforge, for example). Most every mod has a license that dictates what can be done with the mod. If you decide to use a public repository then you can not host mods. You will have to keep track of them in another way
    - List out ways of tracking mods (This doesn't really exist so you may just want to keep track of version numbers in your changelog)


## Changelogs
- To save yourself a lot of headaches later on, you should keep track of all your changes. 
- This changelog is not only to help you as the development process occurs, but also to keep players notified of what’s happening
- TODO - Elaborate further on where to post changelogs


## Why should you have an issue tracker?!
- Makes it easy for users to let you know about any problems they encounter
- You should definitely have an issue template
    - Why? Because you will never know what version people are referring to
    - People will ignore the template. It happens. I try to give people the benefit of the doubt and assume they are unaware of how helpful the template information is
