# **Performance Mods**

## 1.19.2 Minecraft

## Profiling and Logging Mods 
- These mods are excellent at profiling or logging issues you may see in your project:


[Spark](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/spark)
- Spark can profile both Client side rendering and Server Timing/Performance very easily with an easy to use GUI. 

[Cyanide](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cyanide-forge)
- Cyanide is a great tool to help determine any problems you may be experiencing with Datapacks by providing much more logging information. 

[Observable](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/observable)
- Observable is an updated version of Lag Goggles and is always useful to track down anything in your world potentially causing performance issues)


# Performance Mods:
- Your mileage may vary with these mods. They can be helpful but some contexts may not see a difference. Adding them and tracking performance shouldn't be too difficult:

[MemoryLeakFix](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/memoryleakfix)

[Out of Sight](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/out-of-sight)


# Fast Suite Mods 
- These mods reduce the time the server will spend iterating through all recipes in the modpack. In larger modpacks where thousands of items and recipes exist, this will be an extreme benefit. I have begun installing these in any project I work with and have not experienced downside. Shadows_of_Fire is also excellent with bug reports and makes fixes as needed:

[Fast Workbench](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastworkbench)


# Adaptive Performance Suite
- This suite of mods is extremely convenient due to the customization of what features you want to use. Not everything will be applicable to any pack so it's best to read through the config and test as you go to confirm you're seeing a benefit:


[Adaptive Performance Core](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/adaptive-performance-tweaks-core)

[Adaptive Performance Gamerules](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/adaptive-performance-tweaks-gamerules)

# Graphical Changes and Fixes
- The following mods can give good performance results but are also well-known for having mod compatibility trouble. When setting these up, make sure your existing mods still function as expected before publishing your modpack:

[Radon](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/radon)

[Rubidium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rubidium)

# Not Performance But Extremely Useful Mods: 
- I use these in every project I work with

[Shutup Experimental Settings](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/shutup-experimental-settings)

[SwingThroughGrass](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/swingthroughgrass)
