# How to make modpacks

## [**Setup a Developer Environment**](/ide)

## Launcher to play packs

[MultiMC](https://multimc.org/){:target="\_blank"} - MultiMC is a launcher that will easily allow settings per instance

## Launcher for downloading and updating mods (either of these launchers will work fine, it’s preference)

- [GDLauncher](https://gdevs.io/){:target="\_blank"}
- [Curseforge](https://curseforge.overwolf.com/){:target="\_blank"}
- [NBT Explorer](https://github.com/jaquadro/NBTExplorer/releases){:target="\_blank"} (sometimes you’ll need to edit files like level.dat and NBT Explorer will open and allow editing)
- [Region Locator Coordinate Tool](https://dinnerbone.com/minecraft/tools/coordinates/){:target="\_blank"}
  - You will often need to locate a region file

## Sites to use for mods

- [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods){:target="\_blank"}
- **DO NOT** use sites like 9minecraft. These sites not only steal mods but they are not always safe to download from. Frequently they are advertised as mod files but are actually malware or viruses

## Crash Logs

- Most often, when the game crashes it will generate a crash log. Crash logs will be in the “crash-reports” folder located in the Root folder of your instance
  Crash logs can seem pretty daunting at first, but once you get the hang of reading them you can solve your issues much more effectively
- TODO - dive further into crashlog sections to point out useful information

## Playtesting

- Most bad modpacks out there have never been played by the developer or testers. It's impossible to know how a feature or setting will work if you have never experienced it before
- If you don't have people to play the pack for you, that's fine. Playtest it yourself. You'll be much better off having played it yourself than just posting it and hoping it works or that someone finds bugs. All it takes is one really bad bug and that person will be turned off from the pack and possible any future projects you work on
